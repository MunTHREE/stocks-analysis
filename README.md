# stocks-analysis

## Background:

In this project I analyzed a DAQO and other green energy stocks.  I used an extension of excel, VBA, to automate the tasks. This allowed me to re-use the code for any stock as it was not hard-coded specifically for DAQO. This helps minimize human error and improves efficiency.

## Results:
