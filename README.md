## stocks-analysis

#Background:

In this project we were tasked with helping Steve analyze DAQO and other green energy stocks.  We used an extension of excel, VBA, to automate our tasks. This allows to re-use our code for any stock, and not is not just hard-coded for DAQO. This will help minimize human error as the code is much more efficient.

#Results:



#Summary:

I believe it was beneficial to build a base code for this project and there are advantages to doing so before refactoring.  I think it is important to be able to disect a code and see how one pdata piece is affected before looping it through a whole set.  This can help with formatting and debugging specifically.  This could be a disadvantage, however, if there are issues replacing and updating the new variables that are needed for the refactored code.  I struggled personally to get the refactored working, after success with the 2018 code.
